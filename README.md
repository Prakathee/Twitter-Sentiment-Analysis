In this project, we performed Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing techniques. We used the count vectorizer technique and polarity scores to extract features for processing the model and built a logistic regression model to classify the sentiment of tweets. Additionally, we retrieved live tweets using Twitter API and performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the features for anomaly detection. We assigned the target value by calculating the positive and negative word count. Our study highlights the potential of Sentiment Analysis in analyzing Twitter data and understanding public opinion on a particular topic.
